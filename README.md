# React Vite Eslint Prettier Boilerplate (Javascript)

I have found many react + typescript boilerplates with vite, eslint, and prettier but not yet for javascript. So I decided to build one.

```sh
# clone the project
git clone git@github.com:arthuritoker/react-vite-eslint-prettier.git

# open the project directory
cd react-vite-eslint-prettier

# install dependencies
yarn

# start the application
yarn dev

# make a production build
yarn build
```
